## Extracting necessary information defined by the user from the OpenStreetMap.


[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is a map of the world, created by people like you and free to use under an open license.

To exctract the OSM data for a specific region in the world, you can click [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export). However, if you need to download a map of a area consisting more than 50000 nodes, you should visit their [planet](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) website.

#### Data structure
The extracted data are in the **XML** form. You can refer to `sample_map.osm` as an example.
